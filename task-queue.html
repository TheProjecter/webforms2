  <li>Repetition blocks that are not siblings of template are not included in repetitionBlocks list</li>





  <li><font color="#c0c0c0"><strike>Flashing of invalid form controls is not working when there is more than one</strike>.</font></li>





  <li><strike>Unable to remove transparency when hovering over an error message.</strike></li>





  

  <li>Should onadded be preferred over onadd?</li>




  <li><font color="#c0c0c0"><strike>how to determine that an element is
not focusable? We should only focus on a form control which
hasAttribute('autofocus') when it is focusable.</strike></font></li>




  <li>Add DOMAttrModified handlers for repeatStart, et al</li>




  <li>Can we use DOMNodeInserted and just see if it is the child of the document?</li>




  <li>We need to test the implementation in XHTML: is DOMContentLoaded fired after onload in XHTML?</li>




  <li>Make a greasemonkey script available.... webforms2.user.js......... can there be one for MSIE?</li>




  <li>Upload test cases to weston.ruter.net and add redirects from repetition model test cases to these ones</li>




  <li>Can we emulate :valid and :invalid with CSS classNames?</li>



  <li>Note: using document.body as the test for when loaded is not good... XHTML documents will not work with this.</li>


  <li>We should have a function that applies the WF2 (not just validation) behavior to a specific context</li>


  <li>Execute repetition model before Data attributes are prefilled</li>


  <li>What happens when the MAXLENGTH is changed dynamically?</li>


  <li><font color="#c0c0c0"><strike>Positioning of error messages is incorrect in Firefox and MSIE (note offsetLeft)</strike></font>.</li>


  <li><font color="#ff0000">Add onsubmit listener so that
form.checkValidity is called... if checkValidity is called by event
listener (explicitly passed THROW_NO_EXCEPTION argument) &nbsp;then no
exception is raised. If the submit() function is used, then raise an
exception... question: is there a submit event raised when manually
calling submit()??</font>?<br>

  </li>

  <li>Created initWF2Functionality to initialize the validation model,
autofocus, etc. Should the Repetition Model functions be called within
here?</li>
  <li>Add support for form.data and select.data</li>
  <li>Use Ruby's Racc to create RegExes for URL and Email</li>
